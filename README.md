# IoT Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of Internet of Things (IoT) projects! These projects demonstrate how smart devices, sensors, and wireless communication can work together to gather, analyze, and act on real-world data.

Each project combines hardware programming (using ESP32S2 and sensors) with software tools (Python, MQTT, ML/DL models) to build intelligent and connected systems.
